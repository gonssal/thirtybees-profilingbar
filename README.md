# Profiling Bar

Move all the profiling info to a debug toolbar, based on the Symfony one, so it can actually be read.

The most love is for SQL queries, that get syntax highlighting, are limited to 2 lines until you click and have a _copy to clipboard_ button.

This is JavaScript-only, so no overrides.
